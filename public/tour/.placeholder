To test the 3D tour viewer, you need to add 360° panorama images:

1. Download free samples from:
   - https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/
   - Search for "equirectangular panorama"

2. Rename and place them as:
   - entrance.jpg
   - living.jpg
   - bathroom.jpg

3. Images should be 2:1 ratio (e.g., 4096×2048px)

For now, the app will show an error until images are added.
